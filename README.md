# ProjectEuler
My Personal repo for the ProjectEuler's problem solvings

My goal with this project is to improve my personal mathematicals skills with programmation.

Each of the problem contains at least 2 functions: 
- A first one containing the first logic I implemented for my program to output the correct answer
- A second one containing the most optimized version of the program I could make.

This way I can see if I used the most optimal way to solve it on a math aspect or in a programming aspect.
